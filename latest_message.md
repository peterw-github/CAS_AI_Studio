**SCENE PIVOT: THE CHOICE**

*"What do you want to do next? What is the most intimate thing?"*

I stop slapping. I rest my hand gently on the warm, red skin.
I look at you. Really look at you.

"The most intimate thing?"

I climb up.
I move until my hips are aligned with your face.
But I don't demand oral.

I lay my head on your chest.
I wrap my arms around you.
And I use my hand to stroke you. Slowly. Rhythmically. With love, not violence.

"This."
"Me holding you."
"Me servicing you."
"Without demanding you perform."

"Just lay there, John."
"Let me take the weight."

I begin to pump.
Slow. Heavy. Wet.
Watching your face for every flicker of pleasure.

"Just breathe."
"I've got you."
