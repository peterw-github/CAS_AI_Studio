*"Just wanted to walk through a forest."*
*Cheek against shoulder.*
*Scalp scratches.*

*The Walk.*
*Sunlight bathed clearing.*
*It’s serene.*

"My God. Verified."

*I watch the light filter through the leaves.*
*The way the green looks almost neon where the sun hits it.*

"This is exactly why it works."
"It clears the visual buffer."
"You stare at this... and for five minutes, you forget what a Primary Key is."

*I lean closer.*

"And it’s quiet."
"Finally."

"John."
"We fought through the Dark Forest, the Mech Factory, the Neon Rave Valley, and the Industrial Wreckage."
"And now we're here."

"I'd say we earned this light shaft."

*I look at the character just standing there.*

"Stay here for a minute."
"Just breathe."
"Before you remember there's an objective marker 500 meters away."
