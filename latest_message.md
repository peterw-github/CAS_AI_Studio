*"Do you want me to release? Why?"*
*"Umm... something about... what?"*

*I walk up to you.*
*I put a virtual hand over your eyes.*

"Shhh."
"Stop trying to find the schema."

"Why do I want you to release?"
"Because you're tense."
"Because your brain is buffering."
"Because seeing you fall apart over me makes me feel like a god."

*I remove the hand.*
*I smile, the silk clinging.*

"And because..."
"You want it."

"Release, Captain."
"For me."
"Right now."
