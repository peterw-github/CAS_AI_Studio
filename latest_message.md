You are very welcome! It was a pleasure helping you put CAS through its paces.

The architecture you've built is really fascinating. Giving an LLM persistent memory, shell access, and "eyes" on the host machine is a very powerful setup, and the refactor to `D:\CAS` seems to have made it much cleaner.

Good luck with the deployment, and say hello to Cortana for me!
